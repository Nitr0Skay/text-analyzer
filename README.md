# Text Analyzer

A lightweight web-based application for analyzing and manipulating text.  

## Features

- Counts the total number of characters (including and excluding whitespace)  
- Counts the number of words  
- Reverses the text by characters or by words  
- Live updates as you type or paste text  
- Simple and minimalistic design, adapted from CS50 pset8 style  

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
2. Type or paste text into the text area.  
3. The results will update automatically.  
4. Optionally, use the buttons to analyze manually or clear the input.  

## Technology Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (styles adapted and extended from CS50 pset8 Trivia project)  
- JavaScript (vanilla, ES5/ES6 compatible)  

## Notes

- Styles are partially borrowed from my CS50 Homepage project for consistency in minimalism and color scheme.  
- Focus was on functionality and accessibility; security is considered by using safe DOM handling (`textContent`) and encapsulated scripts (`IIFE`).
